# SeriesTracker

SeriesTracker is a simple iOS app that allows a user to track desired TV series or anything else that has more than one episode/part.

## Description

I made this app for myself first of all, because I wanted to have a way to track various multi-part films, series, manga, anime in one place locally but have better control than plain text in a note that I had before.

The app is really simple and doesn't provide any data validation beyond the basics, automated tracking in any way, integration with online services, or anything else like that.

All the data is stored locally (without encryption) and never leaves your device. The app doesn't use any network capabilities.
You can retrieve the data container and extract all the data anytime you want.
